## v0.0.32 (12/27/2019)

- Added the `Export Playground to CodePen` menu item to the `Gists` tree, which allows you to develop a playground locally, and then export it to CodePen in order to share with the community.

  ![Export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71533903-39f60100-28b0-11ea-9e16-891a110c7074.gif)

## v0.0.31 (12/27/2019)

- Added support for referencing external stylsheets in a playground's `playground.json` file. Simply add a URL for a CSS file to the `styles` property, and it will be injected into the preview before your playground's custom styles.

- Added the `Add Playground Script` and `Add Playground Stylesheet` commands to the tree view, to make it easy to add new libraries to a playground without needing to actually open the `playground.json` file. Additionally, these commands now allow you to directly paste a URL, in addition to selecting a library from CDNJS

## v0.0.30 (12/26/2019)

- Added the `Copy File to Gist` context menu to gist file node's in the tree view, which allows easily moving files between gists

## v0.0.29 (12/26/2019)

- Added support for SCSS and Pug to playgrounds, so that you can use them as alternatives to CSS and HTML (respectively). Additionally, introduced a new `GistPad > Playground: Stylesheet Language` and `GistPad > Playground: Markup Language` settings, which allows you to configure `pug` and/or `scss` as the default stylesheet/markup languages can for all new playgrounds.

- Improved the CodePen interop with playgrounds by adding support for pens that...

  - Omit an HTML file (e.g. [ZIM Tree Puzzle](https://gist.github.com/lostintangent/5916cb2b62bbfcdcda0ac108a479bfd2))
  - Reference external stylesheets (e.g. [Hotel Reservation Design](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/pen/eYmWRdm))
  - Use Babel as their scripting language. _Note: Babel support is provided by simply transpiling the Babel code with TypeScript, so there may be some subtle interop problems._

## v0.0.28 (12/24/2019)

- Added support for playgrounds to include relative URLs in their `index.html` file
- Improved the CodePen interop with playgrounds by adding support for pens that omit a script file, which is neccessary for CodePen interop (e.g. [Loading Liquid Animation](https://codepen.io/prathameshkoshti/pen/MWYmzeM)

## v0.0.27 (12/23/2019)

- Added initial support for opening CodePens that have been exported to Gists

  ![CodePen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71393589-171ed080-25c2-11ea-8138-ba075daf7d37.gif)

## v0.0.26 (12/22/2019)

- Introduced the concept of "playground libraries", which allow you to include JavaScript libraries into a playground, by simply adding their URL to the `scripts` property in the playground's `playground.json` file.

- Added support for `.jsx` and `.tsx` files within a playground. If you rename your `script.js` file to one of these extensions, then you can include JSX in the file and it will be automatically compiled. Additionally, the `GistPad > Playground: Script Language` setting now supports two new values: `javascriptreact` and `typescriptreact`. Finally, in order to simplify React-based playgrounds, the `react` and `react-dom` libraries will be automatically injected into React-based playgrounds.

- Added support for `console.log` in web playgrounds. When you open a playground, it will create a new `GistPad Playground` output pane and any calls to `console.log` within your playground will be written to it. By default, the console isn't automatically displayed, but you can either manually open it, or run the `GistPad: Open Playground Console` command.

  ![console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71329302-49540380-24d8-11ea-900c-afbf84b50da9.gif)

* Introduced the `GistPad > Playground: Auto Run` setting, which allows you to control when playground code is run. Additionally, we added the `GistPad: Run Playground` command, which allows you to manually run a playground.

* Added the `Add Document to Gist` command to the editor's context menu (e.g. when you right-click the editor tab).

## v0.0.25 (12/21/2019)

- Added the ability to sort Gists alphabetically, in addition to the default sort behavior of updated time.

## v0.0.24 (12/21/2019)

- Added support for web playgrounds without HTML and/or CSS files. If you don't need them (e.g. because you're primarily using playgrounds for JS dev), then you can delete the files from the playground and everything will still work. Additionally, you can set the `GistPad > Playground: Include Stylesheet` or `GistPad > PlayGround: Include Markup` settings to `false` in order to suppress these files from future playgrounds.
- Fixed markdown files to open in edit mode by default as opposed to preview mode.

## v0.0.23 (12/18/2019)

- Added support for TypeScript to web playgrounds. Simply rename the `script.js` file to `script.ts` and the code will be transparently compiled for you as you code. Additionally, you can set the `GistPad: Playground Script Language` setting to `typescript` in order to create an `script.ts` file for all new playgrounds.
