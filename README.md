# GistPad

[![Join space](https://vslscommunitieswebapp.azurewebsites.net/badge/gistpad)](http://vslscommunitieswebapp.azurewebsites.net/join_redirect/gistpad)

GistPad is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to develop [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) entirely from within the editor. You can open, create, delete and fork Gists, and then seamlessly begin editing files, as if they were local. It's like your very own, cloud-based scratchpad and code snippet manager ðŸš€

## Getting Started

1. Install this extension from the marketplace

   > **Linux Users**: Ensure you have the `gnome-keyring` and `libsecret` packages installed as well. These will enable GistPad to read/write your GitHub auth token securely.

1. Open the `Explorer` tab and expand the `Gists` view. From there, you can open a Gist by ID/URL, or sign-in in wth a GitHub token, in order to view/edit/create/delete Gists.

   > In order to generate a new token, simply visit [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new), give it a name (e.g. `gistpad`), and then check the `gist` checkbox.

1. Add existing files to your Gists by right-clicking them in the `Explorer` tree, or right-clicking an editor window, and selecting `Add Document to Gist` or `Add Selection to Gist` ([details](#contributed-commands-file-explorereditor))

## Contributed Commands (File Explorer/Editor)

In addition to the `Gists` view, this extension also contributes an `Add Document to Gist` command to the context menu of the `Explorer` file tree, as well as the editor window. This makes it easy to add existing files to your Gists.

If you want to add just a snippet of code to a Gist, instead of an entire document, you can select the code, right-click the docucment, and then click `Add Selection to Gist`.

## Contributed Commands (Command Palette)

In addition to the `Gists` view, this extension also provides the following commands:

- `GistPad: Open Gist` - Displays your list of Gists (if you're signed in), and then opens the files for the selected one. You can also specify a Gist ID directly, which doesn't require being signed in.

- `GistPad: Open Gist as Workspace` - Same behavior as the `GistPad: Open Gist` command, but will open the selected Gist as a workspace, istead of "loose files".

- `GistPad: New Gist` - Creates a new [public Gist](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/about-gists#public-gists), and then opens its associated files. If you'd like to seed the gist with multiple files, you can specify a comma-seperated list of names (e.g. `foo.txt,bar.js`).

- `GistPad: New Gist (Secret)` - Same behavior as the `GistPad: New Gist (Public)` command, except that it creates a [secret Gist](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/about-gists#secret-gists).

- `GistPad: Delete Gist` - Allows you to delete one of your Gists. If you have a Gist workspace open, it will delete that and then close the folde

- `GistPad: Starred Gists` - Lists your starred Gists, and then opens the files for the selected one.

- `GistPad: Fork Gist` - Forks the currently opened Gist, and then opens it as a virtual workspace.

- `GistPad: Sign In` - Sign-in with a GitHub token, in order to view/edit/delete your Gists.

- `GistPad: Sign Out` - Sign out of the currently authenticated GitHub session.

## Supported Filesystem Operations

Once you've opened a Gist, you can perform the following filesystem operations:

- Editing existing files
- Adding new files
- Renaming files
- Deleting files
- Copying/pasting files

> GitHub Gist doesn't support directories, and therefore, this extension doesn't allow you to create them.
